Here is a test case for the provided C code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include "p37.c"

int main() {
    int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    if (sockfd == -1) {
        perror("Socket creation failed");
        return 1;
    }
    printf("Socket created successfully\n");
    close(sockfd);
    return 0;
}
```
This test case includes the original file "p37.c" as the first line after system includes, and it also includes a call to `close()` function to ensure that the socket is properly closed before returning from main().
