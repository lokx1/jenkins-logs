Here is a test case for the bubble sort algorithm:
```c
#include "p31.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <assert.h>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {5, 2, 8, 3, 1};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    printf("Array before sorting:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    bubbleSort(arr, n);

    assert(arr[0] == 1 && arr[1] == 2 && arr[2] == 3 && arr[3] == 5 && arr[4] == 8);

    printf("Array after sorting:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```
This test case includes the original file "p31.c" as the first line after system includes, and it uses the `assert` function to check if the sorted array is correct. The `main` function also includes a call to `bubbleSort` with the input array and its size, and then prints both the unsorted and sorted arrays using `printf`.

Note that this test case assumes that the bubble sort algorithm is implemented correctly in "p31.c", so if there are any errors or bugs in the implementation, this test case will fail.
