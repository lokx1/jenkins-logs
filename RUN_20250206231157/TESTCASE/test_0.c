Here is a test case for the given C code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "p43.c"

int main() {
    FILE *file = fopen("nonexistent_file.txt", "r");
    if (file == NULL) {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1;
    }
    fclose(file);
    return 0;
}
```
This test case includes the original code in a new file named `p43.c` and then calls it from a main function. The test case checks that the program opens a file with the name "nonexistent_file.txt" and prints an error message if the file is not found.
