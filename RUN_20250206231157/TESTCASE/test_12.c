Test Case:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "p35.c"

int main() {
    void (*ptr)() = &greet;
    (*ptr)(); // Calling function using function pointer
    return 0;
}
```
Explanation:
The test case includes the original file `p35.c` as the first line after system includes, which is a requirement for including the original code in the test case. The main function calls the `greet()` function using a function pointer, which is a requirement of the original code. The return value of the main function is 0, which is also required by the original code.
