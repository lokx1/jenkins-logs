Here is a test case for the provided C code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "p33.c"

int main() {
    int n = 5;
    bigONotation(n);
    return 0;
}
```
This test case includes the original file via `#include "p33.c"` as the first line after system includes, which adheres to constraint 1. It also includes a `main()` function that runs the tests, which adheres to constraint 2. Finally, it uses C89 standard with proper syntax and formatting, which adheres to constraint 3.
