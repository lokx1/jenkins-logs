Your code is already a complete and correct C code test case for the functions described. It includes initialization of a stack and a queue, pushing and enqueuing elements, and popping and dequeuing elements with appropriate print statements. 

Here's an additional test case to handle overflow and underflow situations:

```c
int main() {
    struct Stack stack;
    stack.top = -1;

    // Test stack overflow
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_SIZE + 1; i++) {
        push(&stack, i);
    }

    // Test stack underflow
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_SIZE + 1; i++) {
        printf("Popped element: %d\n", pop(&stack));
    }

    struct Queue queue;
    queue.front = 0;
    queue.rear = -1;

    // Test queue overflow
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_SIZE + 1; i++) {
        enqueue(&queue, i);
    }

    // Test queue underflow
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_SIZE + 1; i++) {
        printf("Dequeued element: %d\n", dequeue(&queue));
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This test case will print "Stack Overflow" and "Queue Overflow" when trying to push/enqueue more elements than the maximum size, and "Stack Underflow" and "Queue Underflow" when trying to pop/dequeue more elements than exist in the stack/queue.
