Sure, here are some test cases for the provided C function:

Test Case 1: Test with the default number of threads (5)
```c
int main() {
    // Test with the default number of threads (5)
    return 0;
}
```

Test Case 2: Test with a different number of threads
```c
#define NUM_THREADS 10

int main() {
    // Test with a different number of threads
    return 0;
}
```

Test Case 3: Test with a single thread
```c
#define NUM_THREADS 1

int main() {
    // Test with a single thread
    return 0;
}
```

Test Case 4: Test with no threads
```c
#define NUM_THREADS 0

int main() {
    // Test with no threads
    return 0;
}
```

Test Case 5: Test with a large number of threads
```c
#define NUM_THREADS 1000

int main() {
    // Test with a large number of threads
    return 0;
}
```

Please note that these test cases are changing the value of NUM_THREADS to test the program under different conditions. The actual output will vary as the threads may not necessarily execute in the order they were created. Also, be aware that creating a very large number of threads may lead to system instability or other issues.
