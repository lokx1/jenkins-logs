Since the provided code is a command-line argument processor, it's not possible to write test cases within the C code itself. However, you can test this program by running it with different command-line arguments. Here's how you can do it:

1. Compile the code using a C compiler (like gcc). Assume the filename is `program80.c`:
```bash
gcc program80.c -o program80
```

2. Run the program without any arguments:
```bash
./program80
```
You should see a message about usage because the program expects at least one argument.

3. Run the program with one argument:
```bash
./program80 arg1
```
You should see "arg1" printed to the console.

4. Run the program with multiple arguments:
```bash
./program80 arg1 arg2 arg3
```
You should see "arg1", "arg2", and "arg3" printed to the console, each on a new line.

Remember to replace "program80" with whatever you named your executable file.
